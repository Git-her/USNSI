If you're wondering why the project
# About USNST
United States Naval Ship Tracker is completely open source. It is currently in development. The project was inspired by Eastport, ME's, 4th of July, when the U.S Navy ship USS Jason Dunham came in. I had no way to track it, so I made this. If you would like to contribute to the development of USNST, please DM me on Discord about it. (@LeakedWare#0413) I am also open to questions about the software there.
